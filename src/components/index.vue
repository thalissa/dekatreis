    h2 Welcome to Dekatreis
    | Dekatreis is the name of a techno-fantasy world created by Thalissa, also known as Amelia, also known as the one writing this now! This site will be the main central hub for all things that I create for the world of Dekatreis, including rule changes, new races, subclasses, classes, and much more! Even expanding into the true lore of Dekatreis itself.

    | A good starting point would be going to the 
    a(href="/#/lore?lore=HistoryofDekatreis") History of Dekatreis
    |  and then picking a place you want to go from there. The world is full of lore that I will be gradually adding over time--and please give feedback via my 
    a(href="https://twitter.com/ThalissaRemnant") Twitter
