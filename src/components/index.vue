      h2 Welcome to Dekatreis
      | Dekatreis is the name of a techno-fantasy world created by Thalissa, also known as Amelia, also known as the one writing this now! This site will be the main central hub for all things that I create for the world of Dekatreis, including rule changes, new races, subclasses, classes, and much more! Even expanding into the true lore of Dekatreis itself.

      | A good starting point would be going to the 
      a(href="/#/toclore") Dekatreis Lore
      |  page and then picking a place you want to go from there. The world is full of lore that I will be gradually adding over time--and please give feedback via my

      | If you want a quick rundown of what to expect--well, there's a lot of changes from what you might usually be used to in D&D or Pathfinder. I would describe Dekatreis closer to Eberron than Forgotten Realms or Golarion. While some things are set in stone, it's up to the individual game master how to fill in blanks in the world's history and modify things to their liking. The central takeaway from Dekatreis is the central monarch, "The Queen," who reigns in the background while several Princes and Princesses rule the actual kingdoms of the world, usually without interference. If you'd like the Queen to be more involved or change the entire government structure around, I encourage you to modify Dekatreis as you see fit. But, I will forewarn that Dekatreis was built upon the world government structure with a significant portion of the lore happening just due to the influence of the Queen herself, so if you do make her more involved or root her out entirely, then consider what other changes you'll have to make along the way.

      | The next big thing is, as noted above, it's techno-fantasy. There is a central network that everyone can communicate through, using devices like phones and computers and even personal devices integrated with a person's body and mind. Due to the infrastructure and how cities were brought up, personal transportation vehicles are not common, but public transportation such as train networks and teleportation circles interlink all the cities. Most in-between travel that requires more care is solved through the use of animal carts, sometimes using live horses and other times using the benefit of the tireless, cheap services of the undead.
