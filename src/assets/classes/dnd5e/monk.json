          "Expending 10 Elemental Ki as an action, for 1 minute you take on a monsterous form of a giant construct made of stone. Your size becomes huge, you gain additional AC equal to your Wisdom modifier, and the ability to throw chunks of your stone form. These count as a thrown weapon attack that have a range of 60 feet, and deal 4d10 Bludgeoning damage on a hit. Creatures that are hit must also make a Constitution saving throw, falling prone on a failed save."
