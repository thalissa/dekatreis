As such, people from all walks of life can dip into pacts with such creatures.\n\nWhen you gain your 1st level in Warlock, you may choose Intelligence or Wisdom, instead of Charisma, to use for all your class abilities. In addition, the multiclass requirement changes from 13 Charisma to whichever ability score you chose. Once this option has been chosen, it cannot be changed at later levels."
