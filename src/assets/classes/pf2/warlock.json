You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells (see Casting Spells on page 302). Because you're a Warlock, you can usually replace material components with the somatic component of accessing your Spell Tome, so you don't need to use a spell component pouch unless the material has a cost.\n\nEach day, you have a number of spell slots that allow you to cast your spells gained from the Spell Tome feature. You begin play with 2 spell slots. You gain additional spell slots as you increase in level, and your spell slots are always heightened to your maximum casting ability. For example, a 5th level Warlock would have 3 spell slots, all of which are of 3rd level, causing any 1st or 2nd level spells to be heightened as if they were being cast using 3rd level spell slots. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels (page 299).\n\nSome of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). As a Warlock, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use either Intelligence or the modifier of your \"Key Ability\" that is listed for your Patron. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 447.\n\nSome of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, which equals the highest level of spell you can cast as a Warlock. For example, as a 1st level Warlock, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th level Warlock, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells."

Should you ever lose your Spell Tome, you are still able to cast cantrips, but in order to cast your spells again you must perform a ritual over the course of your daily preparations to retrieve your Spell Tome again.\n\nYou add to your Spell Tome as you increase in level. Each time you increase in level, you gain an addition spell for which you have the spell slots for. For example, a 5th level Warlock could choose a new 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level spell.\n\nShould you wish to change a spell in your Spell Tome, whenever you finish your Daily Preparations, you may replace up to three spells in your Spell Tome.
