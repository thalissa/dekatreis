    "Substances that usually have ill effects.",
    "Drugs will usually have an onset, or how long until the initial effect occurs. Before then, there are no signs that the target has taken said substance. Then, the effects come in stages, usually listed with a duration before the next stage sets in. With each new stage, the target makes a new saving throw, and suffers the effects of that stage on a failed save. If the target succeeds, they must make a new saving throw after the previous stage's duration passes again. The target retains all effects of the previous stages until the duration ends."
