Each member of the Court of Sin seeks to doom souls to the Sinful Planes after corruption locks them from the Virtuous Planes, and with mass of souls comes a fight for power between each member of the Court of Sin, dead-set on their own portfolios to be the one that tips the scales to spell the end of the Court of Virtue.\n\nWhether subtle or blatant, creatures and worshipers of the Court of Sin are prevalant throughout all of Dekatreis and work to attempt to undermine the efforts of the Court of Virtue. Whether through temptation or force, the eight members of the Court of Sin manifests in a creature's soul differently, and the more attuned to these vices a creature becomes, the stronger pull the court has on their soul, until inevitably it is corrupted beyond virtue."
