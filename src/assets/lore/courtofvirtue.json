While the Court of Sin thrives off the evil in everyone's souls, the Court of Virtue wishes to draw out the good in every creature's hearts to ensure that they reach the Virtuous Planes.\n\nAlthough not all may know it, many of a person's daily rites and common courtesies can be attributed to the Court of Virtue, from the blessings to the divines to minor aspects of friendship itself. The four deities that make up the Court of Virtue use their loyal followers and creatures bound to them in order to prove that no matter how dark one's aura may tint, that light can last. So long as there is a piece of virtue within, redemption is possible."
