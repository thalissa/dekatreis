If you can't perceive a hidden trap door in a room, you cannot attempt the check again as you have checked all avenues of it. However, some skill checks can be re-done, such as some social skill checks, if done in a different way or by altering the situation in some way. Re-attempting skill checks in these ways are situationally allowed by the game master."
