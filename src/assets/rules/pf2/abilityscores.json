As such, when a player rolls for stats, they may roll 4d6, keeping only the highest 3 results. Additionally, they may reroll any dice that result in a 1 until the result of the dice being rerolled is at least 2. This is done six times and then distributed as the player wishes between their six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.\n\nThis signifigantly bumps up the average ability scores of the players--so those used to running more low-powered games should be cautious at using this method."
