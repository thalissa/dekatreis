As always, the game master is always the decider on what the limit is.\n\n• Defy Death. You may spend one hero point point to automatically stabilize when you are at 0 hitpoints, or use it to stabilize another creature within 120 feet that is at 0 hitpoints. You or the creature you choose to stabilize also regains a number of hitpoints equal to your level.\n• Reroll. You may spend one hero point to reroll a d20 that you have just rolled. You choose whether to keep the new roll or use the old roll.\n• Spell Surge. You may spend hero points on your turn to regain expended spell slots. The combined levels of spell slots you regain may not equal more than the number of hero points you are spending. For example, with 3 hero points you could recover a 2nd level and 1st level spell slot, or a 3rd level spell slot.\n• Quick Moving. You may spend 2 hero points during any turn in combat in order to gain a second turn in combat yourself. You take this turn immediately after the current turn has ended."
