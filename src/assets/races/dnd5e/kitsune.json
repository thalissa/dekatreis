Made by Kavara like all other races on Dekatreis, the Kitsune were once praised as the greatest spellcasters of the world, some even being believed to have a direct connection to the Weave itself. However, after the Demigods departed the world and societies began to grow more greedy, many other magically-inclined creatures began to hunt the Kitsune down to chop off their tails in use for various spells, potions, and powerful rituals. Despite the protections put up for the Kitsune in various kingdoms, the Kitsune Hunters that readily made profit off Kitsune tails overwhelmed the species until they began to use their magic to go into hiding. Kitsune children were taught at early ages how to appear fully human and hide their tails, and parents would make entire fake lives that would hide them safely within communities of other species, hoping that none would catch on to their true nature and lure Kitsune Hunters to their location."
