They began to pitch ideas to Kavara, who experimented with the Book of Creation until she formed two new subraces of human: The Petona, and the Magia. She attached wings to the Petona and bolstered their body, while on the other side, she imbued the Magia with magic and invigorated them with a desire for knowledge and to have expertise in social attributes. With the eventual success of these new breeds of humans, the two subraces prospered and integrated within the world rather quickly, much like their original renditions."

While many of the Demigods were not human, they had learned quickly that they could not breed with each other nor their creations. Any children of the Demigods had to be made through the Book of Creation. As this realisation dawned on them, they decided to turn to Kavara and ask for her assistence, to give the Demigods children. Using two parents as a basis for this new race, Kavara melded their forms together, and after enough experimentation she arrived at what is now known as the \"Kathari,\" a race of humans with the innate magic of the Magia, the innate wings of the Petona, and the bolstered bloodline of the Demigods. The Queen of Dekatreis herself was one such born of this practice, and many more alongside her"

While each subrace had their own names, those without innate wings or magic were simply \"humans,\" until the name Kanae began to surface in Sarille under a law that established Kathari born outside of royalty would have their wings cut and their magic stifled, forcing them to appear and function the same as Kanae. This law, though very controversial, caused the name Kanae to become commonplace as reference to the Dekatrian humans without wings or innate magic."
