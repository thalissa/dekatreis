They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. Though Drow do not commonly exist on Dekatreis, the Dark Elves were tainted by the Drow King's ill intent, and widespread fear forced them into hiding, some turning to resent society and others wishing to prove their good intentions."
